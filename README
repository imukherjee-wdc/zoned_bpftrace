Bpftrace info
Project: https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace
Documentation: https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace/blob/master/docs/reference_guide.md
Build Instructions: https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace/blob/master/README.md

Highly recommended to get the latest from github and build instead of installing the versions
packaged by distributions which are generally older. Bpftrace is a fast moving project and
older versions are likely to have bugs or missing features.
