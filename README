Build Instructions: https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace/blob/master/README.md

It's preferable to get the latest from github and build instead of installing the versions
packages by distributions which are generally older. bpftrace is a fast moving project and
older versions are likely to have bugs or missing features.
